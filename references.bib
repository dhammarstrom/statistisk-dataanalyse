Methods                 :                              Before and following 6 days with standardized training loads after the 1-week high-intensity aerobic-training shock microcycle, both groups were tested in physiological determinants of endurance performance.                                Results                 :                              From pretraining to posttraining, SI achieved a larger improvement than LI in maximal oxygen uptake (5.7\%; 95\% confidence interval, 1.3–10.3;               P               \,=\,.015) and power output at a blood lactate concentration of 4~mmol·L               −1               (3.8\%; 95\% confidence interval, 0.2–7.4;               P               \,=\,.038).

We illustrate the use of such information measures in the context of interpreting P values as compatibility indices. S values help communicate the limited information supplied by conventional statistics and cast a critical light on cutoffs used to judge and construct those statistics. Misinterpretations of statistics may be reduced by interpreting P values and interval estimates using compatibility concepts and S values instead of “significance” and “confidence.”},

  abstract = {An important step when designing an empirical study is to justify the sample size that will be collected. The key aim of a sample size justification for such studies is to explain how the collected data is expected to provide valuable information given the inferential goals of the researcher. In this overview article six approaches are discussed to justify the sample size in a quantitative empirical study: 1) collecting data from (almost) the entire population, 2) choosing a sample size based on resource constraints, 3) performing an a-priori power analysis, 4) planning for a desired accuracy, 5) using heuristics, or 6) explicitly acknowledging the absence of a justification. An important question to consider when justifying sample sizes is which effect sizes are deemed interesting, and the extent to which the data that is collected informs inferences about these effect sizes. Depending on the sample size justification chosen, researchers could consider 1) what the smallest effect size of interest is, 2) which minimal effect size will be statistically significant, 3) which effect sizes they expect (and what they base these expectations on), 4) which effect sizes would be rejected based on a confidence interval around the effect size, 5) which ranges of effects a study has sufficient power to detect based on a sensitivity power analysis, and 6) which effect sizes are expected in a specific research area. Researchers can use the guidelines presented in this article, for example by using the interactive form in the accompanying online Shiny app, to improve their sample size justification, and hopefully, align the informational value of a study with their inferential goals.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Background: Previous epidemiologic results on coffee consumption and lung cancer risk have not been consistent. Furthermore, not all studies have addressed the potential role of tobacco as a confounder in this association. A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effect of coffee consumption on lung cancer risk independent of tobacco use.
            Methods: A systematic review and a meta-analysis based on random effects models were performed using studies from the {PubMed} and {EMBASE} databases, and the references from the retrieved articles. Included were 8 prospective cohorts and 13 case–control studies, which provided data for 19,892 cases and 623,645 non-cases, timeframe 1986–2015.
            Results: The meta-relative risk ({RR}) for coffee drinking, not controlling for tobacco smoking, was 1.09 [95\% confidence interval ({CI}), 1.00–1.19], the reference group was never drinkers. There was significant heterogeneity among the study results (Q = 84.39, I² = 75.1\%, Pheterogeneity \&lt; 0.001). Among non-smokers, coffee was not associated with lung cancer risk ({RR}, 0.92; 95\% {CI}, 0.75–1.10), the reference group was never drinkers. The meta-{RR} for 1 cup per day increase, unadjusted for smoking, was 1.04 (95\% {CI}, 1.03–1.05); the corresponding {RR} for non-smokers was 0.95 (95\% {CI}, 0.83–1.09).
            Conclusions: The pooled estimates indicated that when the potential confounding effect from smoking is controlled for, coffee drinking does not appear to be a lung cancer risk factor. Further pooled analyses, with larger non-smokers population size, are encouraged to confirm these results.
            Impact: This study illustrates that the association between coffee consumption and lung cancer can be confounded by tobacco smoking. Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev; 25(6); 951–7. ©2016 {AACR}.},

This study examines this question by comparing how certain performance variables and player characteristics affect the actual earnings and market values of soccer players in the Norwegian version of the “Premier League,” the so-called Eliteserien. In several important respects, the analyses show that the regression coefficient estimates differ for actual earnings and market values. It is concluded that caution is warranted when interpreting performance variables’ and player characteristics’ effects on market values as they were effects on actual earnings.},

  abstract = {Objectives               To explore the relationship between physical activity over a 10-year period and current symptoms of insomnia, daytime sleepiness and estimated sleep duration in adults aged 39–67.                                         Design               Population-based, multicentre cohort study.                                         Setting               21 centres in nine European countries.                                         Methods               Included were 4339 participants in the third follow-up to the European Community Respiratory Health Survey (ECRHS III), who answered questions on physical activity at baseline (ECRHS II) and questions on physical activity, insomnia symptoms, sleep duration and daytime sleepiness at 10-year follow-up (ECRHS III). Participants who reported that they exercised with a frequency of at least two or more times a week, for 1 hour/week or more, were classified as being physically active. Changes in activity status were categorised into four groups: persistently non-active; became inactive; became active; and persistently active.                                         Main outcome measures               Insomnia, sleep time and daytime sleepiness in relation to physical activity.                                         Results               Altogether, 37\% of participants were persistently non-active, 25\% were persistently active, 20\% became inactive and 18\% became active from baseline to follow-up. Participants who were persistently active were less likely to report difficulties initiating sleep (OR 0.60, 95\% CI 0.45–0.78), a short sleep duration of ≤6 hours/night (OR 0.71, 95\% CI 0.59–0.85) and a long sleep of ≥9 hours/night (OR 0.53, 95\% CI 0.33–0.84) than persistently non-active subjects after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking history and study centre. Daytime sleepiness and difficulties maintaining sleep were not related to physical activity status.                                         Conclusion               Physically active people have a lower risk of some insomnia symptoms and extreme sleep durations, both long and short.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many randomized trials involve measuring a continuous outcome - such as pain, body weight or blood pressure - at baseline and after treatment. In this paper, I compare four possibilities for how such trials can be analyzed: post-treatment; change between baseline and post-treatment; percentage change between baseline and post-treatment and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with baseline score as a covariate. The statistical power of each method was determined for a hypothetical randomized trial under a range of correlations between baseline and post-treatment scores. RESULTS: ANCOVA has the highest statistical power. Change from baseline has acceptable power when correlation between baseline and post-treatment scores is high;when correlation is low, analyzing only post-treatment scores has reasonable power. Percentage change from baseline has the lowest statistical power and was highly sensitive to changes in variance. Theoretical considerations suggest that percentage change from baseline will also fail to protect from bias in the case of baseline imbalance and will lead to an excess of trials with non-normally distributed outcome data. CONCLUSIONS: Percentage change from baseline should not be used in statistical analysis. Trialists wishing to report this statistic should use another method, such as ANCOVA, and convert the results to a percentage change by using mean baseline scores.},
